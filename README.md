# lucys-fun-site

This is a project that will ultimately create a site that utilizes CSS so that it looks like Lucy is eating the dorito chip. 

Further functionality would be to incorporate a button that would continue to speed up the pace that Lucy eats the chip.

Lastly, would be to build a counter that displays the total amount of doritos Lucy has eaten. 

Purely for fun! Site published at: https://peytonf15.github.io/lucys-fun-site/
